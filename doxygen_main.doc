/**
\mainpage Veritas API

Veritas is written in C++ and has Python bindings using [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io).

View the [source code](https://github.com/laudv/veritas) on Github.

\section pybind Python bindings

Notable diffferences between Python API and C++ API:
 - Trees cannot be constructed directly from Python, use veritas::AddTree::add_tree() instead.
 - Integers are used to refer to nodes of a tree. Instead of
    + `tree.root().left().right().get_split()`, use
    + `tree.get_split(tree.right(tree.left(tree.root())))`
 - veritas::Graph is currently not exposed in Python.
 - Evaluation (veritas::Tree::eval(), veritas::AddTree::eval(), veritas::Tree::eval_node()) supports numpy arrays.

Otherwise, the C++ and Python APIs are identical.

\section pyutil Python classes and functions

There are some additional Python utility classes and functions. An overview can be found here: \ref python.
